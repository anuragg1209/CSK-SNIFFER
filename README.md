# CSK-SNIFFER DEMO

CSK-SNIFFER is a demo project for detecting object detection errors using commonsense knowledge. This repository provides all the necessary code and setup instructions to run the demo locally.

---

## 1. Download CSK-SNIFFER Repo

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuragg1209/CSK-SNIFFER.git
cd CSK-SNIFFER
```

---

## 2. Installing CSK-SNIFFER Environment

We recommend using **Python 3.7** and a **MacOSX/Linux** OS for best compatibility. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

```bash
python3.7 -m venv csk-env
source csk-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # You might get a warning to upgrade pip or Python version. Do NOT upgrade, as our dependencies require the older version.
```

---

## 3. Installing Darkflow Implementation of YOLO

We use [Darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) to set up the YOLO model. Install it as follows:

```bash
cd yolo
git clone https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow.git
cd darkflow
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install .
```

---

## 4. Running the App

Return to the home directory (`CSK-SNIFFER`) and run the demo locally:

```bash
cd ../..
python flask_app.py
```

---

## 5. Model Weights

Model weights are included inside the folder `yolo/bin/`. Please download them using [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/):

```bash
git lfs pull
```
